## Motor soft starter Wikipedia
A motor soft starter is a device used with AC electrical motors to temporarily reduce the load and torque in the power train and electric current surge of the motor during start up.This reduces the mechanical stress on the motor and shaft,as well as the electrodynamic stresses on the attached power cables and electrical distribution network,extending the lifespan of the system.Medium voltage soft starter for heavy duty motor control EEPA soft starter is an electronic motor controller used on three phase medium voltage squirrel cage induction motors.During motor starting,the soft starter controls the voltage or current supplied to the motor.Motor start performance is optimized by reducing the total start current while optimizing the torque produced by the motor.
