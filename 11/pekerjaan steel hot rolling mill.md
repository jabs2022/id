MST Hot Rolled Steel MST Cold Rolled Steel ROLLING (METALWORKING) In metalworking,rolling is a metal forming process in which metal stock is passed through one or more pairs of rolls to reduce the thickness and to make the thickness uniform.The concept is similar to the rolling of dough.Rolling is classified according to the temperature of the metal rolled.Steckel mill WikipediaThe material is fed back and forth through the mill until the desired thickness is reached,much like a reversing rolling mill.It is also used to process steel slabs into hot rolled coil.The Steckel mill allows the rolling of a large slab by providing heated reels on both sides of the mill to store the increased length produced during rolling.

The basic oxygen process is the most efficient,while the Bessemer and open hearth methods have become obsolete.Electric furnaces are used to produce high quality steels from selected steel scrap,lime,and mill scale (an iron oxide that forms on the surface of hot steel and falls off as black scale).What is Hot Rolling? Definition from CorrosionpediaThe hot metal is passed between two rolls to flatten it,lengthen it,reduce the cross sectional area and obtain a uniform thickness.Hot rolled steel is the most common product of the hot rolling process,and is widely used in the metal industry either as an end product or.
