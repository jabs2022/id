## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview IntechOpen
The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years,owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries.However,the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and low grade iron ore has been processed.The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking.This chapter shows the status of the pelletizing process.Iron ore sintering ScienceDirectSintering is the most economic and widely used agglomeration process to prepare iron ore fines for blast furnace use.In this chapter,the sintering process is first described and the key steps of the sintering process,namely,granulation and thermal densification,are identified.

## Pelletizing Wikipedia
Pelletizing is the process of compressing or molding a material into the shape of a pellet.A wide range of different materials are pelletized including chemicals,iron ore.Iron ore pelletizing systems MetsoIron ore pelletizing systems.Iron ore fines are agglomerated into pellets and then indurated using a furnace to create iron ore pellets.These are typically fed to a blast furnace or DRI plant as part of the process to make steel.

## What Is Iron Ore Sintering? (with pictures) wisegeek
Aug 10,2019 · Iron ore sintering is a type of powder metallurgy used to pre treat iron before using it in manufacturing applications.Sintering involves heating iron powder to partially,but not completely,melt the iron particles.The exact process used and additional elements involved vary,with some methods.Shift to quality in the iron ore market CRUSep 22,2016 · Assuming ~200 Mt of domestic production is viable longer term,China should also have plenty of domestic concentrate available for pelletising.In 2015,we estimate that only 19% of domestic production was fed to the country's pellet plants,with the remaining 81% of domestic production being used in sintering.
