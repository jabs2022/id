## Introduction to Clay Minerals & Soils
Clay minerals are layer silicates that are formed usually as products of chemical weathering of other silicate minerals at the earth's surface.They are found most often in shales,the most common type of sedimentary rock.In cool,dry,or temperate climates,clay minerals are fairly stable and are an important component of soil.Weathering & Clay MineralsClay Minerals.Clay minerals are an important group of minerals because they are among the most common products of chemical weathering,and thus are the main constituents of the fine grained sedimentary rocks called mudrocks (including mudstones,claystones,and shales).The Illite clays have a structure similar to that of Muscovite,but is.
