## Gold Mining Methods groundtruthtrekking
Summary.Historically,the majority of gold was mined from "placer deposits",where gold has settled out of an existing or ancient waterway downstream of where nuggets had eroded out of rock outcrops.Some early miners also used an early form of hardrock mining,digging solid veins of gold out of rock,where mineralized water had deposited it over thousands of years.Technical Document: Acid Mine Drainage PredictionAcid Mine Drainage Prediction compares acid rock drainage factors of waste rock piles and tailings impoundments.In examining this table,it is important to note that diffusion of oxygen into water is slow and,therefore,oxidation of iron sulfide is inhibited until the water level drops,which can occur periodically or seasonally in some cases.
