## Blast Furnace Slag National Slag Association
Blast Furnace Slag is formed when iron ore or iron pellets,coke and a flux (either limestone or dolomite) are melted together in a blast furnace.When the metallurgical smelting process is complete,the lime in the flux has been chemically combined with the aluminates and silicates of the ore and coke ash to form a non metallic product called blast furnace slag.The Extraction of Iron Chemistry LibreTextsIron ore is not pure iron oxide it also contains an assortment of rocky material that would not melt at the temperature of the furnace,and would eventually clog it up.The limestone is added to convert this into slag which melts and runs to the bottom.The heat of the.

Hematite is the most important iron ore.The iron content of the pure minerals is as follows: Ankerite is a carbonate of lime,magnesia,manganese,and iron.It is of valuable composition,carries only 14 or 15% of iron,and is used more for its lime and magnesia as a flux than for its iron content.Slag WikipediaSlag from steel mills in ferrous smelting,on the other hand,is designed to minimize iron loss and so mainly contains oxides of calcium,silicon,magnesium,and aluminium.Any sandy component or quartz component of the original ore automatically carries through the smelting process as silicon dioxide.
