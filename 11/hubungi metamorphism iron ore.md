## Hematite: A primary ore of iron and a pigment mineral
Uses of Hematite (Iron Ore) Hematite is the world's most important ore of iron.Although magnetite contains a higher percentage of iron and is easier to process,hematite is the leading ore because it is more abundant and present in deposits in many parts of the world.Hematite is mined in some of the largest mines in the world.Labrador Trough WikipediaThe Labrador Trough or the New Quebec Orogen is a 1,600 km (994 mi) long and 160 km (99 mi) wide geologic belt in Canada,extending south southeast from Ungava Bay through Quebec and Labrador.The trough is a linear belt of sedimentary and volcanic rocks which developed in an Early Proterozoic rift basin.To the west is the Archean Superior Craton.

## Different Types of Iron Ore Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Hematite is the most important iron ore.The iron content of the pure minerals is as follows: Ankerite is a carbonate of lime,magnesia,manganese,and iron.It is of valuable composition,carries only 14 or 15% of iron,and is used more for its lime and magnesia as a flux than for its iron content.Origin of sedimentary hosted high grade iron ore deposits• From the 1840s to the 1960s more than 3 billion tonnes of iron ore were mined from sedimentary hosted high grade iron ore deposits in Michigan,Minnesota and Ontario • This abundant source of iron ore coupled with new steelmaking processes helped fuel.

## Magnetite: The mineral Magnetite information and pictures
Magnetite is an important ore of iron.Well formed crystals are popular among mineral collectors,and the magnetic Lodestone variety is frequently sold in hobby shops to amateur collectors.Magnetite is also of significant interest to the science community due to its strong magnetic properties.METAMORPHIC ROCK CHARTIn general,the iron and magnesium rich rocks are altered to schists and amphibolites,whereas the silica and aluminum rich rocks form gneisses,but almost any variation is possible because of variations in intensity of metamorphism and also because of the opportunity for the addition or removal of elements.

## Geology and mineralization connected with the intrusion of.
Iron Mountain is one of three intrusive bodies exposed in the Iron Springs district approximately 15 miles west of Cedar City,Utah.It is the erosional remnant of a quartz monzonite porphyry,intruded into Mesozoic limestone and clastic rocks probably at a depth of less than one mile.The quartz monzonite was intruded in large part along the base of the Carmel formation and has pushed aside.Day 22,Igneous rocks associated with gold and Metamorphic.The Motagua River sands found some evidence of igneous,basalt can see sands,granite,breccias and peridotites,which means that,despite the Motagua fault suffered a huge metamorphic process,over time,coming other slopes,water has dragged pieces of igneous rocks that dragged both iron ore and gold.Metamorphism and Metamorphic Rocks

## Metamorphism geology Britannica
Metamorphism,mineralogical and structural adjustments of solid rocks to physical and chemical conditions differing from those under which the rocks originally formed.Changes produced by surface conditions such as compaction are usually excluded.The most important agents of metamorphism include temperature,pressure,and fluids.(PDF) The Chinese Iron Ore Deposits and Ore ProductionThe BIF were affected by regional metamorphism and associated with volcanic iron siliceous.Shilu iron ore deposit,which is situated at the western Hainan Province of southern China,has been.
