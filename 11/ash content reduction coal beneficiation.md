## COKING COAL BENEFICIATION SciTech Connect
Jul 18,2018 · The basic purpose of beneficiation is to reduce the ash forming impurities from raw coal so that better coal with less ash content can be produced.If these ash forming constituents are not removed,and coal is directly charged to the coke ovens,the ash content in coke will increase and subsequently more slag will be produced in the blast.Trends in coal beneficiation: A review S.G.Gagarin.Trends in coal beneficiation: A review.Therefore,the first beneficiation enterprises mainly processed coking coal,with reduction in the ash content to acceptable levels.Subsequently.
