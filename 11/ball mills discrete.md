## DESIGN OPTIMIZATION OF HIGH ENERGY BALL MILLS BY.
DESIGN OPTIMIZATION OF HIGH ENERGY BALL MILLS BY DISCRETE EVENT SIMULATION Roland Reichardt and Wolfgang Wiechert Department of Simulation University of Siegen D 57068 Siegen,Germany E mail: roland.reichardt@uni siegen.de KEYWORDS Discrete Event Simulation,Design Optimization,Ball Mills.ABSTRACT High energy ball mills are used to grind powderCommunition Simulation using Discrete Element method.Discrete grain breakage simulates ore comminution for 2.0 mill revolutions.Charge volume is 12 percent ore at about 210 mm passing size,and 12 percent ball at 133mm (5.25inch) ball size.The mill was run to steady state with uniform ore and ball mixing before breakage was activated.Reasonable size distributions were achieved after 2.0.
