## Selecting Inching Drives for Mill and Kiln Applications
Selecting Inching Drives for Mill and Kiln Applications Glen Cahala Frank C Uherek,Principal Engineer Gear Engineering Software Development Abstract The inching drive,also known as a barring or auxiliary drive,is an important component of any mill or kiln installation.It is used for maintenance and inspection purposes,asCalculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum GrindingIn Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize "just in case".Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and tear.
