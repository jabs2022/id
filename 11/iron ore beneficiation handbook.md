## Mineral dressing (= Orebeneficiation) kau
Mineral dressing (= Orebeneficiation) The first process most ores undergo after they leave the mine is mineral dressing (processing),also called ore preparation,milling,and ore dressing or ore beneficiation.Ore dressing is a process of mechanically separating the grains of ore minerals from the gangue minerals,to produce a concentrate.Advances in Low Grade Iron Ore Beneficiationinstalling the low grade iron ore beneficiation plant in this region.All these plant will be based on haematite ore as raw material.Based on this analysis,it is clear in India that the installation of beneficiation facilities exclusively for low grade hematitic iron ore beneficiation.

## mining technology: beneficiation of IRON ORE
The rate of reduction of both iron ore and quartz varies (Figures 1 to 3).Quartz dissipates easily,breaking down to fines with little applied stress.Though the hardness value of quartz (i.e.7 on the Mohr's scale) is a bit higher than the iron ore (Hematite (5.5 6.5),Magnetite (5.5 6),it is far more brittle than iron ore (Gribble,1988).Iron ore and its beneficiation: blogspotIron ore and its beneficiation: Most useful metal in the world,Iron,is extracted from iron ore.It is the rock from which metallic iron can be economically extracted.Iron ore is a mineral substance which,when heated in the presence of a reductant,will yield metallic iron (Fe).The iron ore,usually,very rich in iron oxides (Fe3O4 and Fe2O3).
