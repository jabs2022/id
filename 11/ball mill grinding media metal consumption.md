Ball Mills use grinding media in spherical or cylindrical shapes in rotating containers to grind a wide range of material types to very fine sizes.Jars and grinding media are available in a wide variety of material types to optimize performance characteristics for long term wear resistance,low contamination levels,or economical operation.Grinding Balls & Rods Mineral Processing & MetallurgyFrom the standpoint of economy,the larger the media the higher will be the liner consumption and media consumption.The minimum size of grinding balls should be selected with caution since there will be a tendency for such balls to float out of the mill in a dense pulp (this is minimised by the use of a grate discharge mill).

## A discussion on the measurement of grinding media wear.
One of the major problems regarding the use of ball mills is to balance the size distribution of grinding media into the mill,which is determined by the speed of consumption and rate of replacement,as the wear of the grinding balls requires their substitution at
