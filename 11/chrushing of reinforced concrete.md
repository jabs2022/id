## Reinforced concrete Wikipedia
Reinforced concrete (RC) (also called reinforced cement concrete or RCC) is a composite material in which concrete's relatively low tensile strength and ductility are counteracted by the inclusion of reinforcement having higher tensile strength or ductility.The reinforcement is usually,though not necessarily,steel reinforcing bars and is usually embedded passively in the concrete before the.Reinforced Concrete an overview ScienceDirect TopicsReinforced Concrete.Reinforced concrete is a composite material that is characterized by the combination of the high compressive strength of Portland cement concrete,and the ductility and high tensile strength properties of steel,which make it an ideal construction material (Bertolini et al.2004).
