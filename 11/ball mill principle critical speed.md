## Ball Mills Horizontal Ball Mills,Cylindrical Ball Mills
In case peripheral speed of mill is very high,it acts like centrifuge where balls do not fall back and stay on perimeter of mill (this point is called "Critical Speed" ball mills normally operate at 65% to 75% of critical speed) With critical speed (rpm) denoted by formula nC = 42.29 vd (d is internal diameter in meters),a mill with diameter.what is critical speed of ball millBall Mill critical Speed Wiki A Ball Mill Critical Speed (actually ball,rod,AG or SAG) is the speed at which the centrifugal forces equal gravitational forces at the mill shell's inside surface and no balls will fall from its position onto the shell.The imagery below helps explain what goes on inside a mill as speed.

## Variables in Ball Mill Operation Paul O.Abbe®
Ball mill operation is often regarded as something of a mystery for several reasons.Ball milling is not an art it's just physics.The starting point for mill speed calculations is the critical speed.Critical speed (CS) is the speed at which the grinding media will centrifuge against the wall of the cylinder.The principle of mill.ATTRITORS AND BALL MILLS HOW THEY WORK Robert E.The theoretical critical speed of a ball mill is the speed at which the centrifugal force is sufficiently large to cause a small particle to adhere to the shell interior for a full revolution of the mill.The common range of mill speeds is 65% to 80% of critical,depending on mill type,size and the application.
