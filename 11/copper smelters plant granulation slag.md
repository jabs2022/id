## Smelting Wikipedia
Smelting is a process of applying heat to ore in order to extract a base metal.It is a form of extractive metallurgy.It is used to extract many metals from their ores,including silver,iron,copper,and other base metals.Smelting uses heat and a chemical reducing agent to decompose the ore,driving off other elements as gases or slag and leaving the metal base behind.Rio Tinto Kennecott Utah Copper SmelterKennecott Smelter Slag Mill 28.It is here that S slag from the cooled Kress pots is ground and prepped for use as a furnace coolant and to recover the small amount of copper still contained in the slag.Kress pots are cooled by the application of water introduced into the pot over the hot slag.
