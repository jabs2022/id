## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.USING THE SMC TEST® TO PREDICT COMMINUTION.work index covering grinding of fine particles is labelled M ib (Morrell,2008).M ia values are provided as a standard output from a SMC Test® (Morrell,2004a) whilst M ib values can be determined using the data generated by a conventional Bond ball mill work index test (M ib is NOT the Bond ball work index).M ic and M ih values are also.
