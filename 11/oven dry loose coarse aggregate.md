## Density of Aggregate Bulk and Relative Density Civil.
Here,for coarse aggregates,the standard test method has been explained in ASTM C 127(AASHTO) and for fine aggregates,the standard test method has been explained in ASTM C 128 (AASHTO).[3] The relative density of an aggregate can be determined on an oven dry basis or a saturated surface dry.Technical Manual Section 1 Introduction to Lytag.Physical Properties of Lightweight Aggregate Density The oven dry loose bulk density of Lytag® lightweight coarse aggregate is typically in the range of 0.75 to 0.85Mg m3.Oven dry particle densities typically range from 1.40 to 1.50Mg m3.Normal weight aggregates have typical oven dry loose.
