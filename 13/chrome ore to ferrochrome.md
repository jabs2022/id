## Ferrochrome prices finally begin to follow chrome ore.
In recent publications Metal Bulletin Research has highlighted the growing tension between rising raw material prices and flat to falling finished product prices in the global chrome industry.In particular we talk of the recent rise in chrome ore prices and disappointing price movement in spot market ferrochrome prices.WO2011045755A1 Ferrochrome alloy production Google.This invention allows chrome recovery in the production of ferrochrome (known as "charge chrome" or "high carbon ferrochrome") from smelting of chromium ore to be increased from a typical amount of about 70% to 84%,to more than 90%,typically about 95%,by the reduction of Cr 2 0 3 in the slag with silicon from the metal phase of the smelting.
