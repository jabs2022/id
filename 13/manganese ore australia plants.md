## Processing of Groote Eylandt Manganese Ores AusIMM
The manganese ore deposits at Groote Eylandt are quite variable both in regard to grade and physical cond ition.In order to treat a wider range of these ores and to increase production a new primary crusher and' concentrator complex costing 8 million has been installed and commissioned to treat ore.Manganese Ore AIMR 2011 Australian Mines AtlasThe Bureau of Resources and Energy Economics (BREE) reported that Australia produced 7.2 Mt of beneficiated manganese ore in 2012 (7.0 Mt 2011).The total tonnage of manganese ore mined is approximately twice the tonnage of beneficiated manganese ore produced because of yields of around 50% after beneficiation.

## Overview of the Global Manganese Industry
Due to large Mn alloys production cuts,manganese ore demand weakened in China last year.Manganese ore production and imports followed the same trend.4 Focus on China: Mn Ore Prod vs Imports China imported 15.8 million tonnes of manganese ore in 2015,down 3% from the previous year.Manganese ore processing technology and equipmentManganese rich ore resources are mainly concentrated in South Africa,Gabon,Brazil and Australia.For example,the Kalahari mine in South Africa has a manganese ore grade of 30 50 percent,the Groote Eylandt mine in Australia has a manganese ore grade of 40 50 percent,and India,Kazakhstan and Mexico are medium grade manganese resource countries.
