## Introduction to Iron ore Pellets and Pelletizing processes.
The various advantages of iron ore pellets are given below.Iron ore pellet is a kind of agglomerated fines which has better tumbling index when compared with the iron ore and it can be used as a substitute for the iron ore lumps both in the BF and for DRI production.Pellets have good reducibility since they have high porosity (25 % to 30 %).Sinter plant WikipediaSinter plants agglomerate iron ore fines (dust) with other fine materials at high temperature,to create a product that can be used in a blast furnace.The final product,a sinter,is a small,irregular nodule of iron mixed with small amounts of other minerals.The process,called sintering,causes the constituent materials to fuse to make a single porous mass with little change in the chemical.

## Taconite Iron Ore Processing: National Emission Standards.
A taconite iron ore processing facility separates and concentrates iron ore from taconite,a low grade iron ore,and produces taconite pellets,which are approximately 60 percent iron and about ½ inch in diameter.These pellets are then utilized,mainly,in blast furnaces making iron and steel and in the cement industry.Rule HistoryIron ore pelletization ScienceDirectAlthough iron ore concentrates are generally higher in iron grade and contain lower impurities,the finer size distribution of concentrates limits their usage in iron ore sintering.Therefore,pelletizing is needed to produce fired pellets from concentrates as burden materials for blast furnaces.
