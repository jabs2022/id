## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.Ball Mill: Operating principles,components,Uses.Several types of ball mill exist.They differ to an extent in their operating principle.They also differ in their maximum capacity of the milling vessel,ranging from 0.010 litres for planetary ball mill,mixer mill or vibration ball mill to several 100 litres for horizontal rolling ball mills.

## Analysis on Grinding media Motion in Ball Mill by Discrete.
Abstract: Based on the research on the grinding media motion in the ball mill,the discrete equation of grinding media motion about ball mill is established and the motion regimes of grinding media is simulated using the discrete element method (DEM) with simplifying the contact model of grinding media and rock material.How ceramic tile is made material,manufacture,making.The initial step in ceramic tile manufacture involves mixing the ingredients.Sometimes,water is then added and the ingredients are wet milled or ground in a ball mill.If wet milling is used,the excess water is removed using filter pressing followed by spray drying.
