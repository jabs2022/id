The two main types of underground mining in NSW are bord and pillar and longwall mining.Bord and pillar: Bord and pillar,or room and pillar,is the oldest underground mining technique and was common in NSW before longwall mining began in the 1960s.This method uses a grid of tunnels and involves progressively cutting panels into the coal seam.Major Mines & Projects Tweefontein MineUnderground mining is conducted using conventional drill and blast methods (including total extraction mining,i.e.stooping),as well as fully mechanised,continuous miner equipment on a bord and pillar system.Opencast mining is undertaken using the strip mining method with dragline.

Bord and pillar: Bord and pillar,or room and pillar,is the oldest underground mining technique and was common throughout before longwall mining began in the 1960s.This method uses a grid of tunnels and involves progressively cutting panels into the coal seam whilst leaving behind pillars of coal to support the mine.Longwall mining WikipediaLongwall mining is a form of underground coal mining where a long wall of coal is mined in a single slice (typically 0.6 1.0 m thick).The longwall panel (the block of coal that is being mined) is typically 3 4 km long and 250 400 m wide.
