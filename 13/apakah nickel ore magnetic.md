## Can Brass Be Magnetized? Sciencing
Apr 25,2017 · Magnetism affects ferrous,or iron like,metals such as iron,nickel,cobalt and steel.Brass is a combination of copper and zinc,so it technically is nonferrous and incapable of being magnetized.In practice,however,some brass items contain at least traces of iron,so you may be able to detect a weak magnetic.Nickel: Learn How To Trade Precious Metals at CommodityNickel is strong,ductile,magnetic,corrosion resistant and heat resistant.As a result of these favorable properties,nickel has become one of the most widely used metals in the world.Nickel occurs in ore bodies,and breaking down these ore bodies to extract nickel expends energy.

## FPX Nickel Achieves Recoveries up to 99.5% in Production.
Jan 07,2020 · FPX Nickel Achieves Recoveries up to 99.5% in Production of High Grade Nickel Cobalt Solution for the Electric Vehicle Battery MarketIs Nickel a magnetic metal? Yahoo AnswersAug 11,2006 · Usually,that means "magnetic." It isn't a particularly strong ferromagnet compared to iron or cobalt,which may be what your friend means.The other ferromagnetic elements are dysprosim and gadolinium,neither of which are common and both have Curie temperatures below room temperature,so they're kind of useless in most cases as magnetic.
