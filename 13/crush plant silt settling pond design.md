## Design criteria for stormwater ponds Minnesota.
Wherever possible,wetland plants should be encouraged in a pond design,either along the aquatic bench (fringe wetlands),the access bench and side slopes (ED wetlands) or within shallow areas of the pool itself.Design sediment forebay.Types of stormwater ponds; Design criteria for stormwater ponds;Detention Basin fact sheet Dauphin Countyand or including a forebay to the basin in the design when space allows will enhance water quality and quantity benefits.Extended detention will require a larger basin.Forebays trap sediment to pretreat runoff prior to release to the main pond,and also provide additional temporary storage of runoff.

## Settling basin Wikipedia
A settling basin,settling pond or decant pond is an earthen or concrete structure using sedimentation to remove settleable matter and turbidity from wastewater.The basins are used to control water pollution in diverse industries such as agriculture,aquaculture,and mining.Turbidity is an optical property of water caused by scattering of light by material suspended in that water.Sedimentation (water treatment) WikipediaSedimentation is a physical water treatment process using gravity to remove suspended solids from water.Solid particles entrained by the turbulence of moving water may be removed naturally by sedimentation in the still water of lakes and oceans.Settling basins are ponds constructed for the purpose of removing entrained solids by sedimentation.
