## Surface preparation SteelConstructionfo
Depending upon the condition of the steelwork prior to blast cleaning,there may be surface contaminants present other than mill scale and rust.Initial steel surface conditions of Grades A to C are unlikely to be affected,however Grade D condition (steelwork that is pitted) could contain contaminants within the pits that may not be removed by.Rolling (metalworking) WikipediaSoaking pits used to heat steel ingots before rolling.While the finished product is of good quality,the surface is covered in mill scale,which is an oxide that forms at high temperatures.Shape rolling design.Rolling mills are often divided into roughing,intermediate and finishing rolling cages.During shape rolling,an initial.
