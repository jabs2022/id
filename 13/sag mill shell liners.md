## MINE LINERS magotteaux
The two main functions of a mill liner consist in protecting the mill shell against wear and in transmitting the energy of the mill motor to the grinding charge to carry out the required size reduction in the most efficient way.For a mill liner,the design as well as the liner material are to be considered.The required movement of the mill charge to carry out effiSupply SAG mill rubber Lining Factory Quotes OEMSAG mill rubber Lining Rubber liner is widely used in modern concentrator because it has the advantages of impact resistance,corrosion resistance,wear resistance,light weight,long service life,easy installation and replacement,energy saving and noise reduction.The yield of your grinding circuit is highly dependent on your mill's rubber.

The design of mill liners and SAG mill discharge grates will have a large effect on how efficiently the mill operates and the circuit throughput.All models generally assume that a mill is fitted with "efficient" liners and that the grate design neither limits passage of pebbles (and pulp) nor permits re circulation of pulp back into the mill.(PDF) Selection and design of mill liners ResearchGatePDF Dramatic shortcomings of mill liner designs,especially of large semiautogenous grinding (SAG) mills such as rapid failure,mill shell damage arising from the charge impacting directly on.
