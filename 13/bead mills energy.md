## High Energy Bead Mill Horizontal bead mill Bead Mill.
The High Energy Bead Mill can impart more energy to milling media for dispersion than other conventional mills.The geometry of the energizer dispersion tool fluidizes the milling media in toroidal flow pattern to form high energy concentration zones through out the milling chamber.NETZSCH Beads NETZSCH Grinding & DispersingThe selection of the appropriate grinding beads is an outstanding characteristic for optimizing dispersing and wet grinding processes with agitator bead mills.NETZSCH Beads ® offer the best grinding results.

## Ball Mill RETSCH powerful grinding and homogenization
The High Energy Ball Mill E max and MM 500 were developed for grinding with the highest energy input.The innovative design of both,the mills and the grinding jars,allows for continuous grinding down to the nano range in the shortest amount of time with only minor warming effects.These ball mills are also suitable for mechano chemistry.Interaction of energy input and bead abrasion during.Increase of energy in bead mills will decrease the milling time but increase the bead attrition.This interaction was investigated by comminution of an aqueous alumina suspension (d90 = 4.5 µm) in a laboratory attrition mill (AHM90,Hosokawa Alpine AG) under different conditions.
