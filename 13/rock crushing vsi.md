## Impact Crusher Working Principle 911metallurgist
Starting from the base working principle that compression is the forcing of two surfaces towards one another to crush the material caught between them.Impact crushing can be of two variations: gravity and dynamic.An example of gravity impact would be dropping a rock onto a steel plate (similar to what goes on into an Autogenous Mill).Impact Crusher Description Advantages Types of.If crushers that used pressure force is used then it results in unpredictable and even more uneven,jagged shape particles.Therefore,use of VSI crusher results in more cubical and even shapes particles.This is so,because vertical shaft impactor crusher utilizes the velocity force that is applied evenly to the surface and the mass of rock.
