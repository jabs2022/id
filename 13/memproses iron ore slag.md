## Iron Ore Smelting Process Brighthub Engineering
The ore is loaded into a blast furnace along with measured quantities of coke and limestone.Hot combustion air is supplied to the furnace and some form of fuel used to raise the temperature.The iron is reduced from the ore by carbon in the coke,the limestone aiding slag separation from the molten iron.The slag and molten iron are tapped off from the bottom of the furnace,the slag being.Extraction of Iron Metallurgy Blast Furnace and ReactionsThe extraction of iron from its ore is a long and subdued process,that helps in separating the useful components from the waste materials such as slag.What happens in the Blast Furnace? The purpose of a Blast Furnace is to reduce the concentrated ore chemically to its liquid metal state.

Ancient iron production refers to iron working in times from prehistory to the early Middle Ages where knowledge of production processes is derived from archaeological investigation.Slag,the byproduct of iron working processes such as smelting or smithing,is left at the iron working site rather than being moved away with the product.It also weathers well and hence it is readily available.Ores,slag and ash World Customs Organizationiron oxide.2. Slag,ash and residues containing arsenic,mercury,thallium or their mixtures,of a kind used for the extraction of arsenic or those metals or for the manufacture of their chemical compounds,are to be classified in subheading 2620.60.

## How steel is made a summary of a Blast Furnace
To make steel,iron ore is first mined from the ground.It is then smelted in blast furnaces where the impurities are removed and carbon is added.In fact,a very simple definition of steel is "iron alloyed with carbon,usually less than 1%." The following text is taken from the Structural Manual For Ironworkers Manual V Volume I.Iron and SteelmakingA blast furnace charge consists of ore,fluxes and fuel.The ore part of a charge consists of iron ores and concentrates,manganese ores and various types of scrap containing iron.These ore parts are usually contained in a charge as products of a high temperature treatment i.e.as agglomerate or pellets.Agglomerate currently
