## Mill (grinding) Wikipedia
Attrition between grinding balls and ore particles causes grinding of finer particles.SAG mills are characterized by their large diameter and short length as compared to ball mills.The inside of the mill is lined with lifting plates to lift the material inside the mill,where it then falls off the plates onto the rest of the ore.Iron Ore Spot Price (Any Origin): YChartsIron Ore Spot Price (Any Origin) is at a current level of 120.24,up from 108.94 last month and up from 64.56 one year ago.This is a change of 10.37% from last month and 86.25% from one year ago.
