## Uranium from Phosphates Phosphorite Uranium World.
Rock phosphate deposits contain many million tonnes of uranium,which may be extracted as a by product of making fertilisers.Some 20,000 tonnes of uranium has already been obtained from these rock phosphate deposits,but the process became uneconomic in the 1990s.Higher uranium prices and process refinements have changed the economic situation.Use of phosphate rocks for sustainable agricultureExtensive research on the agronomic potential and actual effectiveness of phosphate rocks (PRs) as sources of phosphorus has been carried out in Africa,Asia,Latin America and elsewhere.A wealth of information is available,but it is scattered among meeting proceedings,technical reports and scientific and other publications.This bulletin gives comprehensive coverage of the key topics.
