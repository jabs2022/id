• Feed to Flotation (Vertimill circuit cyclone overflow ) was more stable • Flotation Feed particle size distribution was steeper than without the Vertimill circuit operating • 2 4% recovery improvement from previous operation without the Vertimill,largely a result of a finer feed to flotation.TheyVertimill® Industry benchmark in stirred milling.The capacity of each unit size is relative to the required power input for the intended grind,however,mills have been operated with throughputs exceeding 500 mtph.Lower capital cost.Vertimill® requires a simple and small foundation,which means less floor space is required.
