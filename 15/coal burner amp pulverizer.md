## Pulverized coal fired boiler Wikipedia
A pulverized coal fired boiler is an industrial or utility boiler that generates thermal energy by burning pulverized coal (also known as powdered coal or coal dust since it is as fine as face powder in cosmetic makeup) that is blown into the firebox.The basic idea of a firing system using pulverised fuel is to use the whole volume of the furnace for the combustion of solid fuels.Improved Coal Fineness Improves Performance,Reduces EmissionsThe pulverizer configuration usually found in most coal fired power generation plants is the vertical air swept design,although there are a number of ball tube pulverizers still in service.
