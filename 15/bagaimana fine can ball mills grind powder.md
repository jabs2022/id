## Making Black Powder with a Ball Mill Skylighter
To grind a single chemical (vs.a mix like black powder) using a ball mill,fill your mill jar half full of hardened lead or brass grinding media,and 25% full of potassium nitrate.Turn the mill on and come back in an hour.Your nitrate should be light and fluffy.If not,continue grinding it 'til it's fine powder with no chunks or grains.Ball Mills 911metallurgistIn all ore dressing and milling Operations,including flotation,cyanidation,gravity concentration,and amalgamation,the Working Principle is to crush and grind,often with rob mill & ball mills,the ore in order to liberate the minerals.In the chemical and process industries,grinding is an important step in preparing raw materials for subsequent treatment.
