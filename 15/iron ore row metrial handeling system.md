## How stainless steel is made material,manufacture,used.
Raw Materials Stainless steels are made of some of the basic elements found in the earth: iron ore,chromium,silicon,nickel,carbon,nitrogen,and manganese.Properties of the final alloy are tailored by varying the amounts of these elements.Nitrogen,for instance,improves tensile properties like ductility.Steel Primary steelmaking BritannicaSteel Steel Primary steelmaking: In principle,steelmaking is a melting,purifying,and alloying process carried out at approximately 1,600° C (2,900° F) in molten conditions.Various chemical reactions are initiated,either in sequence or simultaneously,in order to arrive at specified chemical compositions and temperatures.Indeed,many of the reactions interfere with one another.
