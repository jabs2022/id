## Phosphorite Wikipedia
Phosphorite,phosphate rock or rock phosphate is a non detrital sedimentary rock which contains high amounts of phosphate minerals.The phosphate content of phosphorite (or grade of phosphate rock) varies greatly,from 4% to 20% phosphorus pentoxide (P 2 O 5).Marketed phosphate rock is enriched ("beneficiated") to at least 28%,often more than 30% P 2 O 5.This occurs through washing,screening.Developing Phosphorus and Potassium Recommendations for.Recommendations from soil test results are based on soil calibration studies that correlate soil test levels to crop yield response.In Ohio,this response curve data was used to develop Extension Bulletin E 2567: Tri State Fertilizer Recommendations for Corn,Soybeans,Wheat,and Alfalfa,which was a coordinated effort of Michigan State University,The Ohio State University,and Purdue.

## Phosphate Rock
Phosphate Rock.Phosphate Rock is an excellent natural source of phosphorus,calcium and many essential trace elements.It contains over 30 percent total phosphate (3 8 percent available) and 48 percent calcium (as CaO).Phosphate rock has approximately one fifth the neutralizing power of lime.Uranium from Phosphates Phosphorite Uranium World.Phosphate rock (phosphorite) is a marine sedimentary rock which contains 18 40% P 2 O 5,as well as some uranium and all its decay products,often 70 to 200 ppmU,and sometimes up to 800 ppm.The main mineral in the phosphate rock is apatite,and most commonly,fluorapatite Ca 5 (PO 4) 3 F or Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (F,OH) 2.This is insoluble,so.

## Apatite,Phosphorite and Phosphate Rock Geology
Phosphate Rock and Phosphorite.Phosphate rock and phosphorite are names used for sedimentary rocks that contain at least 15% to 20% phosphate on the basis of weight.The phosphorous content in these rocks is mainly derived from the presence of apatite minerals.Using Rock Phosphate For Gardens What Does Rock.Rock phosphate,or phosphorite,is mined from clay deposits that contain phosphorus and is used to make organic phosphate fertilizers that many gardeners utilize.In the past,rock phosphate was used alone as a fertilizer,but due to a lack in supply,as well as low concentration,most applied.
