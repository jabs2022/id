## Moma Titanium Minerals Mine,Mozambique Mining.
The mine has a reserve of around 26 million tonnes of ilmenite,1.8mt of zircon and 0.55mt of rutile under a license to Kenmare as of December 2011.Mining at the Moma titanium deposit.Titanium minerals at Moma are mined through dredging.The mining is carried out at Namalope flats,which was the first deposit mined.Locations of DepositsMost REEs are mined from placer deposits,bedrock,or clay formations (see map below for currently mapped deposits) (Orris,2002).In the early period of mining REEs,they were mined primarily from placer deposits,which are mineral accumulations in rivers and on beaches.
