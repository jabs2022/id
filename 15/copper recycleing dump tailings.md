## TENORM: Copper Mining and Production Wastes Radiation.
Copper mining waste piles may be as large as 400 hectares and typically include three types of waste: Tailings (33%).Dump and heap leach wastes (28%).Waste rock and overburden (39%).Some of the copper mine wastes have been put to use,but on a limited scale.Waste not,want not rethinking the tailings and mine.Circular economies require thinking in terms of the waste hierarchy (reduce,reuse,repurpose,recycle,recover,landfill).The challenge is that the waste hierarchy was originally designed to address embodied mineral content in products,rather than mine waste and tailings generation.
