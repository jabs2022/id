## Magnetic and flotation studies of banded hematite.
Dec 16,2010 · To identify and establish beneficiation techniques for banded hematite quartzite (BHQ) iron ore,a comprehensive research on BHQ ore treatment was carried out.The BHQ ore was assayed as 38.9wt% Fe,42.5wt% SiO 2,and 1.0wt% Al 2 O 3.In this ore,hematite and quartz are present as the major mineral phases where goethite,martite,and magnetite.B.K.Mishra,P.S.R.Reddy,B.Das,Senhance raw material.Technology has been engaged in Iron ore research to S enhance raw material quality for Iron and Steel industry.Consequently,from our experience we discuss the characterization and beneficiation aspects of five different types of Iron ore samples—Barbil,Bailladilla,Goa,Barajamda and Hospet (Banded Hematite Quartzite,BHQ).
