Processing of taconite consists of crushing and grinding the ore to liberate iron bearing particles,concentrating the ore by separating the particles from the waste material (gangue),and pelletizing the iron ore concentrate.A simplified flow diagram of these processing steps is shown in Figure 11.23 1.Liberation is the first step in.Determine the Proper Grind Size for Gold OreWithout mineralogy,estimating the optimum Grind Size for Gold Ore Sample is most conveniently made by Laboratory Testing and the agitation leaching method,and it will be necessary to make up 3 or 4 bottle charges in order to have enough ore* for the subsequent screen analysis.Take an average sample of the ore and grind on the bucking table to pass No.30 sieve.
