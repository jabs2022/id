## Grinding Mills: Ball Mill & Rod Mill Design & Parts
Common types of grinding mills include Ball Mills and Rod Mills.This includes all rotating mills with heavy grinding media loads.This article focuses on ball and rod mills excluding SAG and AG mills.Although their concepts are very similar,they are not discussed here.Photographs of a glass ended laboratory ball mill show action of ball mass within the mill.Rod Mill,Rod Ball Mill,Rod Mill Process,Rod Mill MachineRod mills are very similar to ball mills,except they use long rods for grinding media.The rods grind the ore by tumbling within the the mill.To prevent the conditions leading to rod charge tangling,the length to diameter ratio is maintained at 1.4 to 1.6.
