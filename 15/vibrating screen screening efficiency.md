## THE IMPORTANCE OF VIBRATING SCREEN EFFICIENCY CALCULATION.
On screening decks alone,vibrating screen efficiency uses mathematics to assess sorting performance.Now,while this efficiency quotient is derived by plugging oversize and undersize values into special engineering formulae,just why are the results so important? VIBRATING SCREEN EFFICIENCYScreening Theory and Practice Triple S DynamicsScreening Theory and Practice 1 Part 1.Theory of Screening The purpose of screening is to separate from a granular substance particles that are smaller than the screen opening from those that are larger.This is not as simple as it sounds,and the difficulties compound as the opening becomes smaller.For example,if a sample of a crushed
