## What is a fault and what are the different types?
A fault is a fracture or zone of fractures between two blocks of rock.Faults allow the blocks to move relative to each other.This movement may occur rapidly,in the form of an earthquake or may occur slowly,in the form of creep.Faults may range in length from a few millimeters to thousands of kilometers.Most faults produce repeated displacements over geologicLithium Australia reports high grade lithium.Lithium Australia NL (ASX: LIT) reported that initial assay results of its maiden RC drilling programme within the Youanmi project area in Western Australia show significant widths of high grade.
