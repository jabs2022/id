## Crain's Petrophysical Handbook Igneous And Metamorphic.
Common minerals found in mafic rocks include olivine,pyroxene,amphibole,and biotite.They contain about 46 85% mafic mineral crystals and have a high density.Ultramafic igneous rocks are very dark colored and contain higher amounts of the same common minerals as mafic rocks,about 86 100% mafic mineral crystals.How is the mineral olivine formed? AnswersDriveOlivine is a common rock forming mineral in mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks,but it also occurs in impure metamorphosed carbonate rocks (picture below).It is a very common mineral in the mantle.Some xenoliths from the mantle are almost entirely composed of this mineral.Such a rock.

## What Type of Rock Is Pyrite? Reference
Pyrite is not a rock,but a mineral.It's a member of the sulfide family and is made up of iron and sulfur.Its chemical formula is FeS2.Pyrite's name comes from Greek and alludes to the fact that sparks form when it strikes iron.Pyrite goes into forming igneous,metamorphic and sedimentary rock.Igneous rock Mineralogical components BritannicaIgneous rock Igneous rock Mineralogical components: The major mineralogical components of igneous rocks can be divided into two groups: felsic (from feldspar and silica) and mafic (from magnesium and ferrous iron).The felsic minerals include quartz,tridymite,cristobalite,feldspars (plagioclase and alkali feldspar),feldspathoids (nepheline and leucite),muscovite,and corundum.

## Pictures and Descriptions of Igneous Rock Types
Igneous rocks are those that form via the process of melting and cooling.If they erupt from volcanoes onto the surface as lava,they are called extrusive rocks.By contrast,Intrusive rocks are formed from magma that cools underground.If the intrusive rock cooled underground but near the surface,it is called subvolcanic or hypabyssal,and often has visible,but tiny mineral grains.Geology 101 at Western Washington University StudyBlueTexture and grain size are terms used to describe igneous,sedimentary and metamorphic rocks.It is important to note that the same term can have different meanings for each of the rock types.For an igneous rock,the term texture can be used to refer to:

It also occurs in silica rich igneous rocks,such as granite,rhyolite,or associated pegmatites.Pyrope,the magnesium rich variety is more common in mafic igneous rocks and metamorphosed mafic igneous rocks,while the calcium rich garnets,Grossular and Andradite,are commonly found in metamorphosed carbonate rocks.Pyrite Mineral Uses and Properties GeologyWhat is Pyrite? Pyrite is a brass yellow mineral with a bright metallic luster.It has a chemical composition of iron sulfide (FeS 2) and is the most common sulfide mineral.It forms at high and low temperatures and occurs,usually in small quantities,in igneous,metamorphic,and sedimentary rocks worldwide.Pyrite is so common that many geologists would consider it to be a ubiquitous mineral.

However platinum seems to be much more concentrated in the mantle and can be enriched through magmatic segregation.Platinum's origin in the crust is from ultra mafic igneous rocks and therefore platinum is associated with minerals common to these rocks such as chromite and olivine.Platinum's most common source however is from placer deposits.Igneous and Metamorphic RocksIgneous textures are classified by the presence or absence of crystals,the size of the crystals,and the size and density of vesicles (holes).Check out this page for a nice summary of igneous textures.Extrusive rocks.Pyroclastic rocks: Pyroclastic rocks are classified by grain size from BOMBS (>64mm) to ash (2mm).Lapilli are pea like.

Igneous Rocks.Igneous rock,or magmatic rock,is one of the three main rock types,the others being sedimentary and metamorphic.Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava.The magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks.Types of Wall Rock Alteration ~ Mining GeologyApr 30,2015 · Pyrite is a standard alteration product around sulphide ore deposits (since iron is one of the most abundant metals in the earth's crust).Pyrite forms whenever sulfur is added to a host rock containing iron or ferro magnesian minerals.
