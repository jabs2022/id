## Testwork: Bond rod mill work index SAGMILLING.COM
The Bond rod mill work index is not as common as the Bond ball mill work index,and there are two different variations on the mill apparatus.The SAGMILLING.COM models expect a mill with a "wave liner",and is not compatible with mills using "smooth liners".Testwork: Bond ball mill work index SAGMILLING.COMThe Bond ball mill work index is one of the most commonly used grindability tests in mining,and is often referred to as the Bond work index.The test is a 'locked cycle' test where ground product is removed from test cycles and replaced by fresh feed.
