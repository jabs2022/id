## Synthesis of Nanomaterials by High Energy Ball Milling
For all nanocrystalline materials prepared by high energy ball milling synthesis route,surface and interface contamination is a major concern.In particular,mechanical attributed contamination by the milling tools (Fe or WC) as well as ambient gas (trace impurities such as O 2,N 2 in rare gases) can be problems for high energy ball milling.SPEX SamplePrepSPEX® SamplePrep was founded in 1954 to provide superior sample preparation equipment and supplies for laboratories world wide.Our products are used to prepare samples for a wide range of applications including XRF analysis,DNA RNA Extraction,Pesticide extraction,Borate Fusion and mechanochemistry.
