## How does limestone purify iron Answers
Iron ore is not normally smelted,instead it is reduced in a blast furnace with a mixture of coke & limestone.The coke burns removing the oxygen from the iron ore and melting the resulting iron.Creating Iron HowStuffWorks­The more advanced way to smelt iron is in a blast furnace.A blast furnace is charged with iron ore,charcoal or coke (coke is charcoal made from coal) and limestone (CaCO 3 ­).Huge quantities of air blast in at the bottom of the furnace,and the calcium in the limestone combines with the silicates to form slag.

## Ion exchange of some elements in limestone,dolomite and.
An ion exchange procedure is described for the analysis of dolomite,limestone and chrome iron ore.In dolomite and limestone,calcium and magnesium are separated by eluting with 1M acetate buffer (pH 6) ; in chrome iron ore,chromium(VI) is first separated from other metals by passage through a cation exchanger,Dowex 50W X8 (H+ form),when chromium(VI) is not adsorbed.Limestone Mining Michigan State UniversityLIMESTONE MINING Calcite and dolomite,when heated and in some cases slurried or combined with salt,are used in making many everyday products such as paper,glass,paint and varnish,soap and detergents,textiles,refractories,baking powder,and pharmaceuticals,including milk of magnesia and bicarbonate of soda.

## Sedimentary Mineral Deposits Mineral Processing & Metallurgy
Mechanical Deposition of Sedimentary Mineral Deposits In some cases,the ore mineral,on account of its resistance to weathering and its hardness,survived the destruction of many of the rock minerals; and,during sedimentation,on account of its weight,it was sorted out from the fragments of quartz and other resistant minerals.Thus,the ore mineral was deposited,without being chemically.
