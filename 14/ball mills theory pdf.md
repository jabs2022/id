## Mill (grinding) Wikipedia
SAG is an acronym for Semi Autogenous Grinding.SAG mills are autogenous mills but use grinding balls like a ball mill.A SAG mill is usually a primary or first stage grinder.SAG mills use a ball charge of 8 to 21%.The largest SAG mill is 42' (12.8m) in diameter,powered by a 28 MW (38,000 HP) motor.The operating principle of the ball mill energosteelThe operating principle of the ball mill consists of following steps.In a continuously operating ball mill,feed material fed through the central hole one of the caps into the drum and moves therealong,being exposed by grinding media.The material grinding occurs during impact falling grinding balls and abrasion the particles between the balls.
