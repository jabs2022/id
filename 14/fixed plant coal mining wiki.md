## Mount Arthur  MiningLink The largest & most visited.
The exploration and mining areas of the Mount Arthur Coal Mine consist of the Mount Arthur North Lease which began producing in 2002,the Bayswater No.3 Lease in 1995 and the Bayswater No 2 Lease in 1968.In recent years most production is taking place at the Mount Arthur North Lease.Coal fired power plant Energy EducationMany coal plants are mine mouth which means the plant was put where the coal mine is,so the coal doesn't need to be transported by train.Once unloaded,the coal is then pulverized into a fine powder by a large grinder.This ensures nearly complete burning of the coal in order to maximize the heat given off and to minimize pollutants.

## Germany the voice of coal in Europe
Germany has considerable reserves of hard coal and lignite,making these the country's most important indigenous sources of energy.However,in the case of hard coal,there remain only approximately 20 million tonnes to be extracted following the political decision to end subsidised German hard coal production in 2018.Coal Simple English Wikipedia,the free encyclopediaCoal is a hard rock which can be burned as a solid fossil fuel.It is mostly carbon but also contains hydrogen,sulphur,oxygen and nitrogen.It is a sedimentary rock formed from peat,by the pressure of rocks laid down later on top.Peat,and therefore coal,is formed from the remains of plants which lived millions of years ago in tropical wetlands,such as those of the late Carboniferous.
