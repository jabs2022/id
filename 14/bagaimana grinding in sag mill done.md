## Ball Mill Critical Speed & Working Principle YouTube
Jun 19,2015 · If 75 percent of critical speed is considered desirable for efficient grinding in a 2.4 meter (8 foot) diameter mill,then the same will be true for a 5.0 meter (15½ foot) diameter mill.Autogenous and Semi Autogenous Millsintermediate size ready for final grinding in a ball mill,pebble mill,or VERTIMILLTM.Wet grinding is accomplished in a slurry of 50 to 80 percent solids.AG SAG mills can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening,a rod mill,and some or all of the work of a ball mill.

SAG MILL DISCHARGE SCREENS TROMMEL vs.VIBRATING Tony Moon,RTZ What I'd like to talk about is probably one of the nastiest bits of mill design for a grinding circuit,and that is the choice of what do you use on a SAG mill discharge? Do you use vibrating screens or trommel screens? What many of you probably don't realize is that atPAI SAG Mill Training YouTubeJan 08,2016 · In this training module,we'll cover the workings of a semi autogenous grinding mill,or SAG mill,that's designed to be the first stage of a grinding circuit.Ore that's crushed in a primary.
