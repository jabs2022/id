## Rolling (metalworking) Wikipedia
Hot rolling is a metalworking process that occurs above the recrystallization temperature of the material.After the grains deform during processing,they recrystallize,which maintains an equiaxed microstructure and prevents the metal from work hardening.The starting material is usually large pieces of metal,like semi finished casting products,such as slabs,blooms,and billets.Calculator for Outside Diameter of Roll of MaterialCalculates the outside diameter of a roll of material when the rolled length of the material,thickness of the material,and diameter of the hole in the center or the tube on which the material is wound are given.
