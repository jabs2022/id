## DF2014:Galena Dwarf Fortress Wiki
DF2014:Galena.From Dwarf Fortress Wiki.Galena is an ore of both lead and silver.It is found as veins in a variety of locations.When galena ore is smelted,it will produce 4 lead bars and 0 4 silver bars (with a 50% chance of each silver bar being produced).On average,each nugget of galena will produce two bars of silver when smelted.Farming Silver Ore WoW FarmingFarming Silver Ore in Hillsbrad Foothills.Hillsbrad Foothills is probably the best place to farm Silver and Tin.Just head into the Ruins of Alterac and circle the outer edge near the mountains.Make sure you mine all the minerals you see so that each location has a chance of coming back as Silver.

## Lead Essential Chemical Industry
Lead and zinc ores (usually sphalerite,ZnS) often occur together and may also contain silver,copper and gold.The ore has first to be separated from clays and other silicates ('gangue') after which the lead ore and the zinc ore are separated.The process used is froth flotation,a succession of stages each delivering a greater concentration.Galena For Sale Rocks,Minerals,and FossilsGalena Galena (PbS) typically forms within hydrothermal veins in igneous and metamorphic rocks.Its silvery metallic luster,cubic crystals,and high density make Galena easy to identify.Minerals which contain enough metal to extract easily are called ore minerals,and Galena (lead sulfide) has been a primary ore of lead since ancient times.
