## Variables in Ball Mill Operation Paul O.Abbe®
In ball milling of dry solids the main independent variables are mill diameter,mill speed,media size,solids loading and residence time.For most companies the production mill already exists so we can ignore mill diameter and focus on the other variables.Effect of Slurry Solids Concentration and Ball Loading on.The residence time distribution (RTD) of mineral slurry and slurry holdup volume in an industrial ball mill has been successfully studies using tracer tests.Six different conditions of solids concentration and three levels of ball loading were assessed.The effects of the slurry solids concentration and the ball loading on the mean residence time of slurry were clearly depicted in the results.
