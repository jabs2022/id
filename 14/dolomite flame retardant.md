## Flame Retardant Mineral Fillers and Flame Retardant.
Jun 11,2015 · The present invention relates to the field of flame retardant polymer compositions and therefore to flame retardant or flame retarding mineral fillers to be added to polymers as a flame retardant additive comprising a calcium compound and a magnesium compound.Dolomite Flame RetardantPatent application title: Flame Retardant Mineral [0127] The use as a flame retardant filler,of a dolomite of the same origin as the one used in Examples 1 and 2 (semi hydrated dolomite no.1),but this time,the dolomite from the hydrator is then separated by separation in air in order to cut the grain size curve of the agglomerates at 80 μm,and then the fraction > Get Price; Dissolution Profile of Dolomite in Chloric Acid AIP Publishing

## Electrical Behaviors of Flame Retardant Huntite and.
Nonetheless,mineral nonhalogenated flame retardants release less CO and smoke when compared to halogenated flame retardants [6,8,13].Metal hydroxide flame retardant materials are some of commonly used materials in this matter.They firstly decompose endothermically with releasing water.FLAME RETARDANT AND ANTICORROSIVE SURFACE.] is such a flame retardant,which is commonly used in combination with many polymers.Therefore,in this study,a novel nanocomposite of PANI Mg(OH) 2 is synthesized starting from naturally occurring dolomite.In this method,powdered dolomite was heated,at 900 °C,for 3 h,to produce calcined dolomite (CaO.MgO).
