## Hydrocyclone Wikipedia
A hydrocyclone (often referred to by the shortened form cyclone) is a device to classify,separate or sort particles in a liquid suspension based on the ratio of their centripetal force to fluid resistance.This ratio is high for dense (where separation by density is required) and coarse (where separation by size is required) particles,and low for light and fine particles.Hurricane ACSystemsIt was installed to replace an existing high efficiency cyclone from the spray dryer manufacturer in order to increase powder recovery.Mineral Processing.In the mineral processingindustries,such as calcination or catalysts production,solid intermediates and products are.

## How to Improve Cyclone Separation
Good cyclone separation depends upon control of pressure drop,pulp density and apex size.The 'pressure drop' may vary but should not change rapidly,and is held at safe levels by keeping an adequate sump level.A falling sump level causes cavitation in the pump and reduction in feed rate; pressure drop in the cyclone falls and solids report increasingly to the overflow until the drop.SLURRY PUMPING MANUAL pumpfundamentalsWEIR SLURRY PUMPING MANUAL iv 1 Symbols used The terms slurry and mixture in this Manual are used interchangeably to describe a mix of any loose solids,made up in any proportions and combinations of any particle sizes and any conveying liquid.The subscript w refers to densities and specific gravities of liquids mostly,but not exclusively,water.
