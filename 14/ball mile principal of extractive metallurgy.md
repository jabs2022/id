## Extractive Metallurgy an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The extractive metallurgy of tin is complicated by tin's affinity for iron,and by the need to achieve good metallurgical recovery because of tin's high unit value.Tin has a low melting point of 232 °C,but the smelting temperatures needed are quite high.Figure 1 shows the range of tin processing options.TECHNICAL NOTES 8 GRINDING R.P.King8 3 Centrifugal force outward Fc mp& 2 Dm 2 (8.1) & is the angular velocity,mp is the mass of any particle (media or charge) in the mill and Dm is the diameter of the mill inside the liners.Gravitational force Fg mpg (8.2) The particle will remain against the wall if these two forces are in balance ie.
