## The influence of residual stress on a roll forming process.
Roll forming is increasingly used in the automotive industry to form High Strength Steel (HSS) and Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) for structural components.Because of the large variety of applications of roll forming in the industry,Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is increasingly utilized for roll forming process design.What is Roll Forming welserCold roll forming is a method of shaping hard metals,such as steels and stainless steels.Very precise,complex cross sections can be created,and long lengths of these sections can be consistently reproduced.Along each length,features such as holes,slots,or embosses can easily be added,making the roll forming process a very cost effective method of achieving a strong,multi functional.
