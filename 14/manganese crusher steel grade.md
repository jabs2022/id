## Austenitic Manganese Steel Steel Founders' Society of.
Cone Crusher Liner Set Grades of Manganese: The standard grade of manganese steel (Hadfield's Manganese) used today has roughly 12% manganese and 1.15% carbon.This approximate 10 to 1 ratio from Hadfield's work is the basic target for much of the manganese steel produced even to thisProducts Alloys Austenitic Manganese Steelsan alloy steel.When manganese content exceeds about 10%,the steel will be austenitic after slow cooling.One particular type of steel,known as Hadfield manganese steel,usually contains 12% manganese.Austenitic Manganese Steel Standard & Specifications ASTM Designation 128 A 128M Standard specification for steel castings,austenitic manganese.
