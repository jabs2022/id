Pelletization process.Because the induration of the pellets occur in the rotary kiln,the pellets produced in a Grate KilnTM system are consistently of higher quality than those produced in a straight grate.The rotary kiln provides constant mixing of the pellets,bringing all the pellets to the same temperature.Modelling and Simulation of Thermodynamic Processes of.The process that takes place inside a shaft kiln is complex.In order to describe the process quantitatively and to yield a more robust solution some simplification were made as summarized below: 1.The process inside the kiln is asymmetrical.Hence,it is believed that a 2D model should be
