## How Antimony is Processed by Flotation
The problem discussed in this antimony process study is limited to a concentrator capable of beneficiating 150 tons per day of antimony ore.The antimony in this study occurs as the mineral stibnite (Sb2S3) in association with small amounts of pyrite,arsenopyrite,galena and lead sulfantimonides.The gangue is composed largely of quartz but contains,in addition,a small amount of talc.Process Flow Sheet for Gold and Antimony Recovery from.To avoid the adverse effects of antimony on the cyanide leaching process used for the recovery of gold from refractory gold ore,a cleaner production process was proposed that would selectively.

## The exposure to and health effects of antimony
Part of the northern Palatinate region in Germany is characterised by elevated levels of antimony in the soil due to the presence of ore sources and former mining activities.Antimony has been found in at least 114 different ores.There was no correlation between the antimony contents in the soil of the housing area and those in the urine and hair.Antimony Mineral,Extraction of Antimony,Antimony Mineral.Proportion of antimony ore is far greater than proportion of gangue,so it will be separated by using the method gravity separation.This method has many features,high efficiency,energy saving,and environment protection,which can make the low grade ore enrichment advance.After gravity separation,the antimony will be purified by floatation.
