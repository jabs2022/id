## Improving the performance of railway track through ballast.
A second consideration is the slope of the ballast shoulder away from the track,particularly on an embankment or where the ballast bed is raised above the natural ground so that the shoulder slope continues below sleeper soffit level.There appears to be no international consensus regarding the ballast shoulder slope.In Germany a slopeShoulder Ballast Cleaning Effectivenessshoulder cleaning process was highly effective in removing fines and restoring desirable shoulder ballast support and drainage properties.Further periodic analysis also supports that the fines in the center of the track and along the shoulders tend to move outward and downward during the test with the percentage of fines in the cleaned.
