## Cone Crusher
What are Cone Crushers used for? Cone crushers are used to produce a more finely shaped road grade aggregate product than with jaw crushers.This fineness results from the grinding action inside the cone crusher,where the rock is ground against a cone and concave,and against the stone itself.Compound cone crusher (VSC series cone crusher) can crush materials of over medium hardness.It is mainly used in mining,chemical industry,road and bridge construction,building,etc.As for VSC series cone crusher,there are four crushing cavities (coarse,medium,fine and superfine) to choose.What is the eccentric throw? — Sandvik Mining and Rock.The eccentric throw is one of the most important parameters in defining the job that your cone crusher does.The mantle in a cone crusher spins in conical pendulum motion.That means it doesn’t stay in the center of the chamber it sweeps around moving closer and further away from the concave.This is what creates the crushing action.Cone Crushers.A Cone Crusher is a compression type of machine that reduces material by squeezing or compressing the feed material between a moving piece of steel and a stationary piece of steel.Final sizing and reduction is determined by the closed side setting or the gap between the two crushing members at the lowest point.

## Cone Crusher an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The cone crusher is a modified gyratory crusher.The essential difference is that the shorter spindle of the cone crusher is not suspended,as in the gyratory,but is supported in a curved,universal bearing below the gyratory head or cone (Figure 8.2).Power is transmitted from the source to the countershaft to a V belt or direct drive.Stationary crushers and screensSandvik cone crushers are an excellent choice in secondary,tertiary,quaternary and pebble crushing applications.Stationary jaw crushers.Sandvik jaw crushers are of the single toggle type with advanced features for optimized performance,easy maintenance,long life and a low cost per ton.
