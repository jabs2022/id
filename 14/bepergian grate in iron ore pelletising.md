## Iron Ore Pelletizing Process: An Overview IntechOpen
The iron ore production has significantly expanded in recent years,owing to increasing steel demands in developing countries.However,the content of iron in ore deposits has deteriorated and low grade iron ore has been processed.The fines resulting from the concentration process must be agglomerated for use in iron and steelmaking.This chapter shows the status of the pelletizing process.Neo Solutions Iron Ore Pelletizing AidsIron Ore Pelletizing Aids Iron Ore pelletization is a tumble growth agglomeration mechanism for solid particulates,which must comply with two key points.The first point is to reach,during the balling stage,the capillary state without exceeding it.

Pelletizing grate kiln.Iron ore pellet is a kind of agglomerated fines which has better tumbling index when compared with the iron ore and it can be used as a substitute for the same both in the blast furnace and for DR production.2.Pellets have good reducibility since they have high porosity (25 30%).Normally pellets are reduced.Iron Ore Pellets and Pelletization Process IspatGuruNov 26,2014 · Iron Ore Pellets and Pelletization Process.Pelletizing of iron ore was started in the 1950s to facilitate the utilization of finely ground iron ore concentrates in steel production.For the pelletizing of iron ore there are two main types of processes namely,the straight travelling grate (STG) process and the grate kiln (GK) process.
