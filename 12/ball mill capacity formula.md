## Mill (grinding) Wikipedia
Ball mill.A typical type of fine grinder is the ball mill.A slightly inclined or horizontal rotating cylinder is partially filled with balls,usually stone or metal,which grind material to the necessary fineness by friction and impact with the tumbling balls.Ball mills normally operate with an approximate ball charge of 30%.TECHNICAL NOTES 8 GRINDING R.P.Kingthe mill is used primarily to lift the load (medium and charge).Additional power is required to keep the mill rotating.8.1.3 Power drawn by ball,semi autogenous and autogenous mills A simplified picture of the mill load is shown in Figure 8.3 Ad this can be used to establish the essential features of a model for mill.
