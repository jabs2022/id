## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.Planetary Mills fritsch.dePlanetary Mills are ideally suited for fine grinding of hard,medium hard,soft,brittle,tough and moist materials.The comminution of the material to be ground takes place primarily through the high energy impact of grinding balls in rotating grinding bowls.
