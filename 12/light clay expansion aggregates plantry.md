## Natural building Wikipedia
Cordwood construction is a term used for a natural building method in which "cordwood" or short lengths of pieces of debarked tree are laid up crosswise with masonry or cob mixtures to build a wall.The cordwood,thus,becomes infill for the walls,usually between posts in a timber frame structure.Cordwood masonry can be combined with other methods (e.g.rammed earth,cob or light clay) to.ENGINEERING CLASSIFICATION AND DESCRIPTION OF SOILOrganic clay —clay with sufficient organic content to in fluence the soil properties is an organic clay.For classifi cation,an organic clay is a soil that would be classified as a clay except that its liquid limit value after oven drying is less than 75 percent of its liquid limit value before oven drying.

## Siliceous Vs.Carbonate Concrete Hunker
Carbonate concrete consists of aggregate that is primarily composed of dolomite and limestone.Siliceous concrete,on the other hand,consists primarily of sandstone and granite,but also contains silica.These are stronger than lightweight concrete,which made up of shale,clay and slate.Buildings on Clay buildingconservationFor example,not all buildings resting on clay foundations are affected by clay shrink swell.If the clay material remains moist throughout the year then its volume will not change.The same is true if the soil remains continually dry,as under a paved car park for example.
