## Grinding Aids for Ball Mills Industrial Efficiency.
A ball mill generally loses its grinding efficiency remarkably at fine grinding.This is because fine particles from ground materials agglomerate and adhere to the mill liners or grinding media as coating,reducing the impulsive force of the mill.In addition,the agglomerated particles are mixed into the coarse powder in the separator and recirculated through the mill.Vrm Presentation Mill (Grinding) CementROLLER MILL.Used in cement industry Vertical Mills used for Pre grinding of clinker (lumps to coarse powder) Finish grinding (lumps to powder) of Coal Petcoke for kiln Raw materials for kiln Cement,OPC or mixed Slag,pure or mixed VRM Functions Vertical Roller Mill (VRM) Details feed gate (air lock) mill casing water injection dam ring louvre ring nozzle of material scraper mill outlet.
