## Different Types of Iron Ore 911metallurgist
Sulphur in the ore goes partly into the iron and steel and makes them brittle.While it is possible by roasting the ore and by other means to remove the sulphur,the presence of any considerable amount is objectionable.Phosphorus in steel makes it brittle.For steel making the limit for phosphorus is one hundredth of one per cent for ten per.From ore to steel ArcelorMittalA mixture of iron ore and coal is then heated in a blast furnace to produce molten iron,or pig iron,from which steel is made.ArcelorMittal has a diversified fleet of production facilities to make steel,both basic oxygen furnaces and electric arc furnaces.
