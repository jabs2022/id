## Kiln Energy Efficiency ANSAC
Thermal efficiency is,ultimately,the crucial factor to the successful operation of any kiln.Ansac are a market leader in the control of thermal processes and are able to take our experiences gained over the last quarter of a century in the production of various pieces of capital thermal equipment to produce the most efficient kiln available.Cement kiln WikipediaPAHs (according to EPA 610) in the exhaust gas of rotary kilns usually appear at a distribution dominated by naphthalene,which accounts for a share of more than 90% by mass.The rotary kiln systems of the cement industry destroy virtually completely the PAHs input via fuels.Emissions are generated from organic constituents in the raw material.
