## Magnetite Wikipedia
Magnetite is a rock mineral and one of the main iron ores,with the chemical formula Fe 3 O 4.It is one of the oxides of iron,and is ferrimagnetic; it is attracted to a magnet and can be magnetized to become a permanent magnet itself.It is the most magnetic of all the naturally occurring minerals on Earth.Magnetic Properties of the Precambrian Granitic Rocks in.These results indicate the MD magnetite grains dominate the magnetic properties but more or less PSD (or single domain (SD)) magnetite grains are present in the granitic rocks.The separated crystals of feldspar and quartz show the Verwey transition at 120 K and the Curie temperature of about 580°C.
