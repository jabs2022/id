## The cement mill
Cement manufacturing brief description of a cement mill.Cement clinker is usually ground using a ball mill.This is essentially a large rotating drum containing grinding media normally steel balls.As the drum rotates,the motion of the balls crushes the clinker.Grinding systems are either 'open circuit' or 'closed circuit.' In an.Continuous Rod and Ball Mills SeporOptional peripheral discharge is for coarse grinding with minimum production of fines or slimes.Flexible for wet or dry grinding in open or closed circuit as a rod,ball or pebble mill and as an overflow or peripheral discharge rod mill.Advantages.The continuous grinding mills are designed for 24 hour per day continuous abrasive duty.
