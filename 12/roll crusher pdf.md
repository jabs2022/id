## Crusher Bearings: Knowing the basics leads to better care
Mar 03,2016 · Crusher Bearings: Knowing the basics leads to better care.Contributed.March 3,2016.High shock loads and severe contamination make rock and aggregate crushers among the toughest applications for precision components—particularly roller bearings.The harsh environments in which crushers operate present a big challenge to bearing performance.Double Roll Crusher McNally SayajiToothed Double Roll Crusher is used for Secondary and Tertiary Crushing of soft to medium hard material like lignite,coal,fertilizer,gypsum,chalk,clay,limestone,coke,sinter,etc.OPERATING PRINCIPLE Due to inward opposite rotation of the rolls,the feed material is nipped between the rolls and crushed by piercing and compression.

## 2PG SERIES DOUBLE ROLLER CRUSHER
Double roll crushers are used for both,primary and secondary crushing.They guarantee a strictly defined final grain size with a minimum of fine grains.Raw materials,secondary materials and by products such as coke,sinter,coal,soft to medium hard rock,ore,chalk,broken glass and similar products.Double roller crusher 2PG1012&nbsp;&#0183;&#32;roll to be held back from the solidly mounted roll.Crushing rolls Unlike jaw and gyratory crushers,where reduction is progressive by repeated pressure as the materialMarcy&#174; Double Roll Crushers Laval LabDouble Roll Crushers are useful for intermediate size reduction of hard to medium hard materials,such as rock or ore,after processing with a jaw crusher,for final reduction with a pulverizer.They also bridge the gap between laboratory and continuous production or pilot plant crushing capacities.The roller crusher is suitable for metallurgy,building materials,refractory materials and other industrial sectors broken,higher hardness of the material.The series of roll crusher is mainly composed of the roller,the roller support bearings,compaction and adjusting device and driving unit and other parts.
