## Mill (grinding) Wikipedia
A mill is a device that breaks solid materials into smaller pieces by grinding,crushing,or cutting.Such comminution is an important unit operation in many processes.There are many different types of mills and many types of materials processed in them.Historically mills were powered by hand (e.g.via a hand crank),working animal (e.g.horse mill),wind or water ().AMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills & Circuits Mining Mill.Mill Type Overview.Three types of mill design are common.The Overflow Discharge mill is best suited for fine grinding to 75 106 microns.; The Diaphram or Grate Discharge mill keeps coarse particles within the mill for additional grinding and typically used for grinds to 150 250 microns.; The Center Periphery Discharge mill has feed reporting from both ends and the product discharges.
