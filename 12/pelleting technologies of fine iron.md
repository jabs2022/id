## Stability of vitamins in pelleting WATTAgNet
Chapter 16: Vitamin Stability during Pelleting Chemical modification A chemical modification can enhance stability without adversely affecting the vitamin's bioavailability.The crystalline form of vitamin C is easily destroyed by moisture and pelleting,and exposure to trace minerals such as copper and iron potentiates losses.Pellet Technology Pellet Manufacturers Association of IndiaThis means that fine and ultra fine iron ores will command an ever larger share of iron ore sales in the future.For this reason,a growing number of iron and steel producers are looking into the possibility of increasing the portion of pellets in their production operations.The use of pellets,however,leads to a number of issues.
