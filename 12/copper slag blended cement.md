## Use of recycled copper slag for blended cements de Rojas.
Copper slag is a by‐product generated during smelting to extract copper metal from the ore.The copper slag obtained may exhibit pozzolanic activity and may therefore be used in the manufacture of addition‐containing cements.In this paper the effect of the incorporation of the copper slag in cement.Copper Slag Mortar PropertiesCopper slag is a copper industry waste that is essentially used as an abrasive for metals to remove coatings or paintings,due to its hardness,sieve distribution and rough surface,mainly in the naval industry.After the wearing process,copper slag retains most of its original properties,and remaining an environmental problem.
