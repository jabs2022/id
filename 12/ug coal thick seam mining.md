of coal mining in Virginia.Ventilation in a thin seam coal mine follows the same rules and principles as ventilation in thick seam coal mining.The main difference is the design of the method to extract the coal.In tlris case we are suggesting an automated coal winning system that can be run and maintained by miners in tlle development.Comparison of rockburst occurrence during extraction of.Oct 10,2018 · In recent years,rockbursts have occurred frequently during the mining of thick coal seams in China.Use of the top coal caving or slicing mining method to extract these thick seams may result in distinct geomechanical responses in the strata and,in turn,the pattern of rockburst occurrence around longwall layouts.
