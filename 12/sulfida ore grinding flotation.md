## Flotation experiment research on a polymetallic sulfide.
The polymetallic sulfide ore of copper,lead,and zinc is widely found all over the world and is often associated with rare metals such as gold and silver.The economic value of the comprehensive recycling of this of ore is large[1].The polymetallic sulfide ores of copper,lead,and zinc are usually processed via flotation,and the concentrates ofCopper Sulfide Ore Flotation Technologies XinhaiCopper sulfide ore has good inherent floatability,so flotation process is a mature method used for copper sulfide ore separation.In recent years,with the continuous development of copper sulphide flotation technology,many scholars also proposed a series of new principles of mineral processing,such as "collect early,loss early" and "more crushing and less grinding".
