## Conveyor belt Wikipedia
A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor).A belt conveyor system is one of many types of conveyor systems.A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums),with an endless loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them.Maintaining The Nature Of Rubber With Conveyor Belt.Jun 22,2018 · Vulcanization is the process of treating rubber and rubber like products with compounds like sulphur at high temperatures to improve its strength and elasticity.Any such vulcanization process is carried out by modifying three parameters namely,time,temperature and pressure.Conveyor belt vulcanizing uses rubber of the ATRBZ type for connecting its ends.
