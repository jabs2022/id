## A MIX DESIGN METHODOLOGY FOR CONCRETE BLOCK.
The coarse aggregates most employed in concrete block production are those that pass through a 3 8 in (9.5 mm) sieve and are retained by a number 4 (4.8 mm) sieve.Preferably,the aggregate particles' shape must be cubic,which allows use of larger amounts in concrete mixtures without altering the block's surface texture.(PDF) compressive strength of sandcrete blocks Orjinta.The range of strength for sandcrete blocks specified by N.I.S 74:1976 is between1.8N mm2 to 2.5N mm2 as the minimum strength.The blocks can cope with thermal and moisture conditions,and the problem of algae growth on the face of block work during construction is unlikely to affect the strength of the block (Edward,1985).
