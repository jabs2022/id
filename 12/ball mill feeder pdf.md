## Ball End mill speeds practicalmachinist
Dec 29,2009 · Important consideration for a ball end mill is feed rate.Along with that decreased surface speed toward the center goes increased chip load.Start your feed at half what you would use for a similar straight cutter in the same material,at the same rpm.Ball Mill an overview ScienceDirect TopicsThe ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.
