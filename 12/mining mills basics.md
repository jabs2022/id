## Gold Milling Process Primitive and Basic
Here is an Ancient Gold Ore Milling Process used in China in the 1800s.We might use it again after WW3.At the time,1890,the Author said "There is,of course,nothing for us to learn from this imperfect and rudimentary gold extraction process described here,which is doubtless destined to disappear ere long,before the progress of scientific mining,now making itself slowly felt.Home Mining Industry ProfessionalsThe mining industry is so colossal that I thought it would be genuine to set off the first among several conversations not in terms of sectors (crushing,maintenance,drilling,processing,tunneling,underground mining,etc.),but connectivity,for what it is worth,which I believe is one of the most sensitive aspects in mining as it touches.
