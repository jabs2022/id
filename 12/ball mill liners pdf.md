## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.Cutting edge Mill Liners FLSmidthPulpMax Composite Mill Liners are high performance lightweight mill liners uniquely constructed with a rubber,ceramic matrix,and carefully selected high hardness steel inserts.Designed for a number of minerals processing applications,they are customisable to fit the specifications of your SAG or ball mill.

## Discrete element method modelling of liner wear in dry.
mill liner profiles Valderrama et al.(1996) performed tests of measurement of the wear of lifters in a laboratory ball mill.The object of those tests was to study the role of cascading and cataracting motion of balls on the wear of liners.They used a mill having a diameter of 0.28 m and a length of 0.11 m.The mill.Classification liner for the second chamber of the ball.The second chamber of a ball mill is mainly for fine grinding.Therefore,using small balls was known to be more efficient as this increases the surface area of media and improves the grinding effect.For the conventional mill using a liner with lifter,however,it was difficult to reduce the ball diameter drastically because the grinding efficiency is extremely lowered by reverse.
