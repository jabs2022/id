## What is Frac Sand? A Durable Sand for Hydraulic Fracturing
"Frac sand" is a high purity quartz sand with very durable and very round grains.It is a crush resistant material produced for use by the petroleum industry.It is used in the hydraulic fracturing process (known as "fracking") to produce petroleum fluids,such as oil,natural gas and natural gas.Sand Media Specificationsmedia for intermittent sand filters is a coarse sand with an effective size between 0.3 mm and 0.5 mm.The media sand grains should be relatively uniform in size having a low Uc value (less than 4.0) to promote movement of water and prevent clogging.KEYWORDS: sand .
