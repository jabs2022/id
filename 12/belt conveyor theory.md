## Conveyor belt Wikipedia
A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor).A belt conveyor system is one of many types of conveyor systems.A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums),with an endless loop of carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them.One or both of the pulleys are powered,moving the belt.CALCULATION OF TENSION FORCE OF BELT CONVEYORA theory and calculations are inseparably bound.Without a verified theory taking all the factors into account one cannot make accurate calculations and so one cannot optimally design a belt conveyor.Tension force is calculated according to principle scheme of the belt conveyor during the coal transportation which is presented in figure 1.
