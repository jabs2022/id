## Fabrication of a miniature diamond grinding tool
A novel miniature diamond grinding tool usable for the precise micro grinding of miniature parts is presented.A hybrid process that combines 'micro EDM' with 'precision co deposition' is proposed.The metal substrate is micro EDMed to a 50 µm diameter andUltra small scale grinding with diamond electric plating.Abstract.For establishing the basic technology of micro manufacture with diamond grains on hard and brittle materials,this paper studied the optimization condition of the ultra small scale grinding with diamond electric plating tool through analyzing the kinematics and mechanics model of the helical feed drilling mechanical grinding method.
